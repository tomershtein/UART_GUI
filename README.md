# UART_GUI
UART connection setup GUI using python:

This project uses two main libaries in Python: pyserial and tkinter.
The GUI is made with tkinter.
The GUI gets baud rate from the user with an input and send it to a function that uses features from pyserial.

Things that need to be adjusted:
- Output from uart_init to be displayed on the GUI.
- Check the function with a microprocessor.
- The GUI design is very basic. Work on it?
